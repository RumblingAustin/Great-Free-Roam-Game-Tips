         <h1>This Is The Best Website</h1>

 <p>Welcome to my website! <a href="/about">Read more about me...</a></p>
      <p> This one is on skyrim. In the event of wizards mauling your knees, you need to have a a good character and that is what i am here for. so what you need to do is even out your perks so that you dont have to worry about not having something for your build.
 if you want to have a massive beefy kinda chunky dude/girl you need to specialize in heavy armor and two handed weapons.whilst being chunky dont be upgrading any sneak abilities or magic because you would be ultimatley screwing up your perks, unless you feel like doing that though im not here to judge. That is An example so just do something like that and you sahould be good.

      <p> Now we are talking about fallout 4 which in case you dont know is the best game ever.now what you do is write down what perks you are going to do for which level and their are a lot of perks,
       so spread them out and be smart about. Always carry a mega bat like luicille and go ham on the thieves. You can be completely be charisma. In a charisma build you can make people stick um up and have them do horrible or good.
       You can lie and ultimately kill people with your lies. You can convince them of truth
