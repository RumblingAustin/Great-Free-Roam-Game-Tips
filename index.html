 </head> The making of a good build

 <body>
<p> This one is on skyrim. In the event of wizards mauling your knees, you need to have a a good character and that is what i am here for. so what you need to do is even out your perks so that you dont have to worry about not having something for your build.
 if you want to have a massive beefy kinda chunky dude/girl you need to specialize in heavy armor and two handed weapons.whilst being chunky dont be upgrading any sneak abilities or magic because you would be ultimatley screwing up your perks, unless you feel like doing that though im not here to judge.
